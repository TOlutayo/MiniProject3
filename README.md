# MiniProject3
Demonstrating Python visualization tools (mainly spectrum, matplotlib and pylab) using Spectograms and Periodograms.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The goal of this project is to demonstarte the visualization capabilities of python libraries in the field of Digital Signal Processing. Examples using spectograms and periodograms were chosen as they integrate various aspects of DSP as such providing ample opportunity to showcase the visualization tools available to us from the python libraries.

# SPECTOGRAMS
Spectograms are an incredibly useful tool in visualizing the variation of frequency components in a signal. First some background information. In signal processing, fourier transforms are used to decompose a signal into its frequency components. A more low level explanation: Every signal can be represented as a sum of complex exponentials at different frequencies
